# 🚀 Simple NixOS Setup Guide (For Windows Users!)

**Coming from Windows?** This guide will get your NixOS system working in **3 easy steps**.

## 🎯 What This Does (In Simple Terms)

Think of this like a **Windows setup program** that automatically:
- Installs your desktop (like Windows 11 with apps)
- Sets up remote access (like Windows Remote Desktop)
- Connects to your file server (like mapping network drives)
- Configures security (like Windows Firewall)

## 📋 What You Get

✅ **Complete Desktop**: GNOME (like macOS/Windows 11 style)  
✅ **All Apps**: Firefox, VS Code, Office apps, etc.  
✅ **Remote Access**: Connect from other computers  
✅ **File Server**: Access your shared files  
✅ **Automatic Updates**: Like Windows Update but better  

## 🚀 How to Use This (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Get the Files
On your NixOS computer, open Terminal and type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moawia82/nixconf.git
cd nixconf
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup (Like a Windows Installer)
```bash
sudo ./easy-setup.sh
```
That's it! The script does everything automatically.

### Step 3: Reboot
```bash
sudo reboot
```

## 🔧 What Files Do What (Simple Explanation)

| File | What It Does | Like Windows |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `configuration.nix` | Main system settings | Registry + Control Panel |
| `secrets.yaml` | Passwords and server info | Encrypted password file |
| `easy-setup.sh` | Does everything for you | Windows installer |
| `.gitignore` | Protects private files | Hidden/system files |

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### "Help! I broke something!"
```bash
# Go back to working version
sudo nixos-rebuild --rollback switch
```

### "I want to start over completely!"
```bash
# Download fresh copy
rm -rf nixconf
git clone https://github.com/moawia82/nixconf.git
cd nixconf
sudo ./easy-setup.sh
```

### "How do I connect to my files from Windows?"
After setup, from your Windows computer:
- Open File Explorer
- Type: `\\YOUR_NIXOS_IP\shared`
- Use your username and password

## 💡 Pro Tips for Windows Users

1. **Terminal = Command Prompt**: Don't be scared of the black window!
2. **sudo = Run as Administrator**: It asks for your password
3. **Ctrl+C = Cancel**: Stop any running command
4. **Tab key = Autocomplete**: Like pressing Tab in Windows
5. **Up arrow = Previous command**: Like Command History

## 🔐 Security (Don't Worry!)

- Your passwords are encrypted (like BitLocker)
- Safe to share this on internet
- No one can see your private info
- Automatic security updates
